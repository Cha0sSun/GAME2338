## Summary
Skyrim is a Game that has dragons returning to the world of Tamriel, as a civil war rages on Skyrim between the Stormcloaks and the Empire. The Stormcloaks are a faction led by the usurper Ulfric Stormcloak now ruling Skyrim because he killed the previous king. The Empire is led by the Emperor commanding the Imperials. You play as the Dragonborn, someone who is born with the blood and soul of a dragon. You must discover why the dragons are returning to Tamriel along with choosing a faction and ending the civil war.  
Skyrim is Single player adventure RPG open world game. You will choose one out of 10 races to play as in the game. They are Imperial, Nord, Breton, Redguard, High elf, Dark elf, Wood elf, Orc, Argonian and Khajiits. You can use Swords, bow and arrows along with Spells to fight against any foes that come your way. You can go dungeon crawling for artifacts or buy a house to store all that items collected from fighting, dungeon crawling, stealing and buying items.
The combat is very engaging. You may hold a sword and shield, but you can mix it up however you want. The melee weapons like the Sword are good for fast attack with less damage than the Axe. The Axe is a mid-damage and speed weapon. The Mace is a slow but high damage weapon with armor break. Spells can have different effects on a target that can be from calm to fear, how ever the three most used are flames, sparks and frostbite. The weapons and spells lack some of the types from the previous games in the series, such as poison and spears.


## Final Thoughts
Skyrim is a good mix of RPG and open world, and it works well together. The RPG elements such as stat building provide a dynamic gameplay. As you increase your stats in game you can feel the affect in the game play. Some the negative of Skyrim is the elimination of the spears, poison spells and a wider weapon type. The occasional glitch in the game can cause frustration during gameplay. Over all Skyrim provides an entertaining gaming experience.
