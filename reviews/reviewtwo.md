Summary
  Cultist Simulator is an indie card game simulator about creating a cult. Your goal is to become immortal. This game can be very difficult to play and get into at first. This is one of the games that you would need to experiment or play through more than once to figure out what you need to do win the game. Limited help is available through pop up indexes. 
  At the start of the game you pick from one of the legacies. Legacies affect what you start off with at the beginning of the game. This will determine what your first action and card will be.  Actions are player-initiated, and these actions are what can be done in the game. There are two types of actions, permanent actions and temporary actions. Permanent Actions are the most used actions in the game, and they are work, study, dream, explore and talk. Temporary actions are despair to sickness. They only last for a time but they can produce one or more result and the result can be negative or positive. The game has a temporary action that takes a card called funds. A fund is the common currency in the game. Another currency is spintria which has four difference variations. They are iron, bronze, silver and gold which also can be used in rites, to buy language from patrons or auctioned for an amount of funds.
  The player has three main ability cards, Health, Reason and Passion. They will be needed to do permanent actions. Those three abilities will be what are used most throughout the game. Health is used for physique skills and it can be upgraded with vitality. If you get sick one of the health cards turns into an affliction card which turns into a wound. If you let the timer on the wound hit zero, the character will die. Reason is used for books, lore and the study action. It can be upgraded with erudition. Passion can be used for work and along with more creative or imagination skills can be upgraded with glimmering.
  There are other characters that you can interact with and they are mortals and spirits. Mortals can be broken up into certain groups like acquaintances, followers, patrons, detectives, hirelings, pawns and prisoners. Detectives are not allies as they are trying to stop you. Spirits are temporary followers that can only be summoned by ritual. If fail to summon them correctly they will break free and attack you. 
  You have 9 principles or lore which are color coded that can be used as the base for your societies or cult. The principles can evolve and increase in magnitude. There are also 9 societies that can be made from the principles and they have different colors to match their lore. You can increase the power of lore by fusing it with the same lore or a lore that adds into it.
